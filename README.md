**ASSIGNMENT OF FRONT-END**

Make a form validation using JavaScript that checks only for required text input fields. The validation should prevent the form from being submitted if any of the required fields are empty. Use JavaScript to loop through each input field, check if its value is empty, and display an alert message if needed. This ensures that users fill in all necessary text fields before the form is processed.
